threw up a bunch of assignments on Teams. The assignments were to make us read up 
on the Nano and some sensors/actuators. 

Mentioned us using github and quizzed us at the end of the week
on git commands (even tho we are using github desktop and not the CLI)

at this point , I think most people in the class just picked whatever project
LP seemed to like (because it was impossible to know if your project was 
good or not)

LP looked over my teams project proposal and 'approved it' 
then gave us advice for Draft 2  (why is there a draft 2 and not just a final version after lol) 

submitted our draft 2 (not sure what he wants to do with it now)
