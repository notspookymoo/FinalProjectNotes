class monday cancelled

getting lots of team assignments and omnivox portals with no explanations

got back 1 grade for nano quiz (i have a feeling it was not graded properly)

doing re test for git quiz (i opted out because my first attempt was ok lol)

made us read out loud all the system requirements for almost 2 hours

gave us back grades for project proposal and they were graded weirdly 
(bonus marks for revision: some got it and some didn't despise us 
showing him our first draft and following changes he asked for)

gave us a reading assignment where we have to write a resume of one of the readings ???

a few teams at this point have already ordered parts for their projects
without LP's approval because we're way behind on everything.
