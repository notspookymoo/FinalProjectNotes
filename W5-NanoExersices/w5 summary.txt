Had an assignment open on teams for testing more Nano functionalities

IMU,RTC,WDT. Wrote code to test them and he said I didnt actually need to do anything (more effort wasted :D)

Im pretty sure this week he spent every class teaching us how to 
use github but repeated the same topic over and over again.

At this point we're still pretty lost despite having documentation
Some teams have or are thinking of ordering parts just to get a move on
(because it feels like the project will never be complete at this point)
